# PHP-NVD-NIST-API-script
A script thrown together for grabbing data from the NVD NIST Vulnerabilities API, found here: https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities.


## In the config.php file needed for API key authentication
```php
<?php 
define("apiKeyConfig", "apiKey: [API KEY]"); //replace [API KEY] with a given API key
?>
```
